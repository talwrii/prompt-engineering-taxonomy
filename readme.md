# Philosophy

* Some prompts *constrain* what GPT does.

In a sense all the GPT does is constrain based on previous input - but this is obvious.

* Some prompts give information to GPT.

* Some prmopts

# Framing

* Are you access the right frame for the task you are doing
** Abstraction control [escu]
* Have you given the information required for thest task
* Is it clear what the model should do 


# Constraints

## Ontology what are we constraining

## Cookbook

### Clear markers [escu]

"Try to have clear markers separating all sections of the prompt. That might mean simply an additional newline, or maybe some vertical bars (the pipe symbol) or so on."


# Frame selection

## Common words

Apparently common words are better than specfici words when selecting thing [escu]

How this differs from other resources. It does not necessarily, but this is this guide. This is probably a bit more philosophical than other guides.

* https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide  This is a good guide with a bit of a taxonomy.
